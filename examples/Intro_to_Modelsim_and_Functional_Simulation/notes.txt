1 way to do functional simulation:
-create modelsim project
-add files to project
-compile
-simulate

In industry this is a time consuming process, a better way to simulate our design
is to used TCL aka Tool Command Language to write scripts that execute what we need to
simulate our design.

Afterwards we can just use the command, "do file_name.do" to compile and run the simulation

red or blue lines in modelsim usually indicate that wires are not properly connected in your simulation.
